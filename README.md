# 🧠 What to Expect in Each SolutionFor every problem posted here,
I strive to include:Problem Statement: 
1. A brief summary of what the question asks.
2. Intuition/Approach: The thought process behind solving the problem, moving from brute force to optimized solutions.
3. Code: Clean, well-commented code in Java or C/C++.
4. Complexity Analysis: Clear breakdown of both
 Time and Space complexities (e.g., $O(N \log N)$ time, $O(1)$ space).
# 💡 Why Maintain This Repo?
- Consistency:To build a strict habit of solving at least one algorithmic problem every day.
- Documentation: To create a personal library of algorithms and patterns that I can revisit during my preparations for exams and interviews.
- Community: To share my approaches and learn from others. If my explanation helps even one person understand a tricky concept, it's a win!
#🚀 How to Use This RepoFeel free to explore the solutions!
If you are stuck on a POTD, you can check my approach.
# Note: I highly recommend trying to solve the problem on your own before looking at the code!
